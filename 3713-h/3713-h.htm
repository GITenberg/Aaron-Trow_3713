<h1>AARON TROW.</h1>
<p>I <span class="smcap">would</span> wish to declare, at the
beginning of this story, that I shall never regard that cluster
of islets which we call Bermuda as the Fortunate Islands of the
ancients.&nbsp; Do not let professional geographers take me up,
and say that no one has so accounted them, and that the ancients
have never been supposed to have gotten themselves so far
westwards.&nbsp; What I mean to assert is this&mdash;that, had
any ancient been carried thither by enterprise or stress of
weather, he would not have given those islands so good a
name.&nbsp; That the Neapolitan sailors of King Alonzo should
have been wrecked here, I consider to be more likely.&nbsp; The
vexed Bermoothes is a good name for them.&nbsp; There is no
getting in or out of them without the greatest difficulty, and a
patient, slow navigation, which is very heart-rending.&nbsp; That
Caliban should have lived here I can imagine; that Ariel would
have been sick of the place is certain; and that Governor
Prospero should have been willing to abandon his governorship, I
conceive to have been only natural.&nbsp; When one regards the
present state of the place, one is tempted to doubt whether any
of the governors have been conjurors since his days.</p>
<p>Bermuda, as all the world knows, is a British colony at which
we maintain a convict establishment.&nbsp; Most of our outlying
convict establishments have been sent back upon our hands from
our colonies, but here one is still maintained.&nbsp; There is
also in the islands a strong military fortress, though not a
fortress looking magnificent to the eyes of civilians, as do
Malta and Gibraltar.&nbsp; There are also here some six thousand
white people and some six thousand black people, eating,
drinking, sleeping, and dying.</p>
<p>The convict establishment is the most notable feature of
Bermuda to a stranger, but it does not seem to attract much
attention from the regular inhabitants of the place.&nbsp; There
is no intercourse between the prisoners and the Bermudians.&nbsp;
The convicts are rarely seen by them, and the convict islands are
rarely visited.&nbsp; As to the prisoners themselves, of course
it is not open to them&mdash;or should not be open to
them&mdash;to have intercourse with any but the prison
authorities.</p>
<p>There have, however, been instances in which convicts have
escaped from their confinement, and made their way out among the
islands.&nbsp; Poor wretches!&nbsp; As a rule, there is but
little chance for any that can so escape.&nbsp; The whole length
of the cluster is but twenty miles, and the breadth is under
four.&nbsp; The prisoners are, of course, white men, and the
lower orders of Bermuda, among whom alone could a runagate have
any chance of hiding himself, are all negroes; so that such a one
would be known at once.&nbsp; Their clothes are all marked.&nbsp;
Their only chance of a permanent escape would be in the hold of
an American ship; but what captain of an American or other ship
would willingly encumber himself with an escaped convict?&nbsp;
But, nevertheless, men have escaped; and in one instance, I
believe, a convict got away, so that of him no farther tidings
were ever heard.</p>
<p>For the truth of the following tale I will not by any means
vouch.&nbsp; If one were to inquire on the spot one might
probably find that the ladies all believe it, and the old men;
that all the young men know exactly how much of it is false and
how much true; and that the steady, middle-aged, well-to-do
islanders are quite convinced that it is romance from beginning
to end.&nbsp; My readers may range themselves with the ladies,
the young men, or the steady, well-to-do, middle-aged islanders,
as they please.</p>
<p>Some years ago, soon after the prison was first established on
its present footing, three men did escape from it, and among them
a certain notorious prisoner named Aaron Trow.&nbsp; Trow&rsquo;s
antecedents in England had not been so villanously bad as those
of many of his fellow-convicts, though the one offence for which
he was punished had been of a deep dye: he had shed man&rsquo;s
blood.&nbsp; At a period of great distress in a manufacturing
town he had led men on to riot, and with his own hand had slain
the first constable who had endeavoured to do his duty against
him.&nbsp; There had been courage in the doing of the deed, and
probably no malice; but the deed, let its moral blackness have
been what it might, had sent him to Bermuda, with a sentence
against him of penal servitude for life.&nbsp; Had he been then
amenable to prison discipline,&mdash;even then, with such a
sentence against him as that,&mdash;he might have won his way
back, after the lapse of years, to the children, and perhaps, to
the wife, that he had left behind him; but he was amenable to no
rules&mdash;to no discipline.&nbsp; His heart was sore to death
with an idea of injury, and he lashed himself against the bars of
his cage with a feeling that it would be well if he could so lash
himself till he might perish in his fury.</p>
<p>And then a day came in which an attempt was made by a large
body of convicts, under his leadership, to get the better of the
officers of the prison.&nbsp; It is hardly necessary to say that
the attempt failed.&nbsp; Such attempts always fail.&nbsp; It
failed on this occasion signally, and Trow, with two other men,
were condemned to be scourged terribly, and then kept in solitary
confinement for some lengthened term of months.&nbsp; Before,
however, the day of scourging came, Trow and his two associates
had escaped.</p>
<p>I have not the space to tell how this was effected, nor the
power to describe the manner.&nbsp; They did escape from the
establishment into the islands, and though two of them were taken
after a single day&rsquo;s run at liberty, Aaron Trow had not
been yet retaken even when a week was over.&nbsp; When a month
was over he had not been retaken, and the officers of the prison
began to say that he had got away from them in a vessel to the
States.&nbsp; It was impossible, they said, that he should have
remained in the islands and not been discovered.&nbsp; It was not
impossible that he might have destroyed himself, leaving his body
where it had not yet been found.&nbsp; But he could not have
lived on in Bermuda during that month&rsquo;s search.&nbsp; So,
at least, said the officers of the prison.&nbsp; There was,
however, a report through the islands that he had been seen from
time to time; that he had gotten bread from the negroes at night,
threatening them with death if they told of his whereabouts; and
that all the clothes of the mate of a vessel had been stolen
while the man was bathing, including a suit of dark blue cloth,
in which suit of clothes, or in one of such a nature, a stranger
had been seen skulking about the rocks near St. George.&nbsp; All
this the governor of the prison affected to disbelieve, but the
opinion was becoming very rife in the islands that Aaron Trow was
still there.</p>
<p>A vigilant search, however, is a task of great labour, and
cannot be kept up for ever.&nbsp; By degrees it was
relaxed.&nbsp; The warders and gaolers ceased to patrol the
island roads by night, and it was agreed that Aaron Trow was
gone, or that he would be starved to death, or that he would in
time be driven to leave such traces of his whereabouts as must
lead to his discovery; and this at last did turn out to be the
fact.</p>
<p>There is a sort of prettiness about these islands which,
though it never rises to the loveliness of romantic scenery, is
nevertheless attractive in its way.&nbsp; The land breaks itself
into little knolls, and the sea runs up, hither and thither, in a
thousand creeks and inlets; and then, too, when the oleanders are
in bloom, they give a wonderfully bright colour to the
landscape.&nbsp; Oleanders seem to be the roses of Bermuda, and
are cultivated round all the villages of the better class through
the islands.&nbsp; There are two towns, St. George and Hamilton,
and one main high-road, which connects them; but even this
high-road is broken by a ferry, over which every vehicle going
from St. George to Hamilton must be conveyed.&nbsp; Most of the
locomotion in these parts is done by boats, and the residents
look to the sea, with its narrow creeks, as their best highway
from their farms to their best market.&nbsp; In those
days&mdash;and those days were not very long since&mdash;the
building of small ships was their chief trade, and they valued
their land mostly for the small scrubby cedar-trees with which
this trade was carried on.</p>
<p>As one goes from St. George to Hamilton the road runs between
two seas; that to the right is the ocean; that on the left is an
inland creek, which runs up through a large portion of the
islands, so that the land on the other side of it is near to the
traveller.&nbsp; For a considerable portion of the way there are
no houses lying near the road, and, there is one residence, some
way from the road, so secluded that no other house lies within a
mile of it by land.&nbsp; By water it might probably be reached
within half a mile.&nbsp; This place was called Crump Island, and
here lived, and had lived for many years, an old gentleman, a
native of Bermuda, whose business it had been to buy up cedar
wood and sell it to the ship-builders at Hamilton.&nbsp; In our
story we shall not have very much to do with old Mr. Bergen, but
it will be necessary to say a word or two about his house.</p>
<p>It stood upon what would have been an island in the creek, had
not a narrow causeway, barely broad enough for a road, joined it
to that larger island on which stands the town of St.
George.&nbsp; As the main road approaches the ferry it runs
through some rough, hilly, open ground, which on the right side
towards the ocean has never been cultivated.&nbsp; The distance
from the ocean here may, perhaps, be a quarter of a mile, and the
ground is for the most part covered with low furze.&nbsp; On the
left of the road the land is cultivated in patches, and here,
some half mile or more from the ferry, a path turns away to Crump
Island.&nbsp; The house cannot be seen from the road, and,
indeed, can hardly be seen at all, except from the sea.&nbsp; It
lies, perhaps, three furlongs from the high road, and the path to
it is but little used, as the passage to and from it is chiefly
made by water.</p>
<p>Here, at the time of our story, lived Mr. Bergen, and here
lived Mr. Bergen&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; Miss Bergen was well
known at St. George&rsquo;s as a steady, good girl, who spent her
time in looking after her father&rsquo;s household matters, in
managing his two black maid-servants and the black gardener, and
who did her duty in that sphere of life to which she had been
called.&nbsp; She was a comely, well-shaped young woman, with a
sweet countenance, rather large in size, and very quiet in
demeanour.&nbsp; In her earlier years, when young girls usually
first bud forth into womanly beauty, the neighbours had not
thought much of Anastasia Bergen, nor had the young men of St.
George been wont to stay their boats under the window of Crump
Cottage in order that they might listen to her voice or feel the
light of her eye; but slowly, as years went by, Anastasia Bergen
became a woman that a man might well love; and a man learned to
love her who was well worthy of a woman&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; This
was Caleb Morton, the Presbyterian minister of St. George; and
Caleb Morton had been engaged to marry Miss Bergen for the last
two years past, at the period of Aaron Trow&rsquo;s escape from
prison.</p>
<p>Caleb Morton was not a native of Bermuda, but had been sent
thither by the synod of his church from Nova Scotia.&nbsp; He was
a tall, handsome man, at this time of some thirty years of age,
of a presence which might almost have been called
commanding.&nbsp; He was very strong, but of a temperament which
did not often give him opportunity to put forth his strength; and
his life had been such that neither he nor others knew of what
nature might be his courage.&nbsp; The greater part of his life
was spent in preaching to some few of the white people around
him, and in teaching as many of the blacks as he could get to
hear him.&nbsp; His days were very quiet, and had been altogether
without excitement until he had met with Anastasia Bergen.&nbsp;
It will suffice for us to say that he did meet her, and that now,
for two years past, they had been engaged as man and wife.</p>
<p>Old Mr. Bergen, when he heard of the engagement, was not well
pleased at the information.&nbsp; In the first place, his
daughter was very necessary to him, and the idea of her marrying
and going away had hardly as yet occurred to him; and then he was
by no means inclined to part with any of his money.&nbsp; It must
not be presumed that he had amassed a fortune by his trade in
cedar wood.&nbsp; Few tradesmen in Bermuda do, as I imagine,
amass fortunes.&nbsp; Of some few hundred pounds he was
possessed, and these, in the course of nature, would go to his
daughter when he died; but he had no inclination to hand any
portion of them over to his daughter before they did go to her in
the course of nature.&nbsp; Now, the income which Caleb Morton
earned as a Presbyterian clergyman was not large, and, therefore,
no day had been fixed as yet for his marriage with Anastasia.</p>
<p>But, though the old man had been from the first averse to the
match, his hostility had not been active.&nbsp; He had not
forbidden Mr. Morton his house, or affected to be in any degree
angry because his daughter had a lover.&nbsp; He had merely
grumbled forth an intimation that those who marry in haste repent
at leisure,&mdash;that love kept nobody warm if the pot did not
boil; and that, as for him, it was as much as he could do to keep
his own pot boiling at Crump Cottage.&nbsp; In answer to this
Anastasia said nothing.&nbsp; She asked him for no money, but
still kept his accounts, managed his household, and looked
patiently forward for better days.</p>
<p>Old Mr. Bergen himself spent much of his time at Hamilton,
where he had a woodyard with a couple of rooms attached to
it.&nbsp; It was his custom to remain here three nights of the
week, during which Anastasia was left alone at the cottage; and
it happened by no means seldom that she was altogether alone, for
the negro whom they called the gardener would go to her
father&rsquo;s place at Hamilton, and the two black girls would
crawl away up to the road, tired with the monotony of the sea at
the cottage.&nbsp; Caleb had more than once told her that she was
too much alone, but she had laughed at him, saying that solitude
in Bermuda was not dangerous.&nbsp; Nor, indeed, was it; for the
people are quiet and well-mannered, lacking much energy, but
being, in the same degree, free from any propensity to
violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are going,&rdquo; she said to her lover, one
evening, as he rose from the chair on which he had been swinging
himself at the door of the cottage which looks down over the
creek of the sea.&nbsp; He had sat there for an hour talking to
her as she worked, or watching her as she moved about the
place.&nbsp; It was a beautiful evening, and the sun had been
falling to rest with almost tropical glory before his feet.&nbsp;
The bright oleanders were red with their blossoms all around him,
and he had thoroughly enjoyed his hour of easy rest.&nbsp;
&ldquo;So you are going,&rdquo; she said to him, not putting her
work out of her hand as he rose to depart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and it is time for me to go.&nbsp; I have still
work to do before I can get to bed.&nbsp; Ah, well; I suppose the
day will come at last when I need not leave you as soon as my
hour of rest is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come; of course it will come.&nbsp; That is, if your
reverence should choose to wait for it another ten years or
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you would not mind waiting twenty
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if a certain friend of mine would come down and see
me of evenings when I&rsquo;m alone after the day.&nbsp; It seems
to me that I shouldn&rsquo;t mind waiting as long as I had that
to look for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right not to be impatient,&rdquo; he said to
her, after a pause, as he held her hand before he went.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Quite right.&nbsp; I only wish I could school myself to be
as easy about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not say I was easy,&rdquo; said Anastasia.&nbsp;
&ldquo;People are seldom easy in this world, I take it.&nbsp; I
said I could be patient.&nbsp; Do not look in that way, as though
you pretended that you were dissatisfied with me.&nbsp; You know
that I am true to you, and you ought to be very proud of
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am proud of you, Anastasia&mdash;&rdquo; on hearing
which she got up and courtesied to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am proud
of you; so proud of you that I feel you should not be left here
all alone, with no one to help you if you were in
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Women don&rsquo;t get into trouble as men do, and do
not want any one to help them.&nbsp; If you were alone in the
house you would have to go to bed without your supper, because
you could not make a basin of boiled milk ready for your own
meal.&nbsp; Now, when your reverence has gone, I shall go to work
and have my tea comfortably.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he did go,
bidding God bless her as he left her.&nbsp; Three hours after
that he was disturbed in his own lodgings by one of the negro
girls from the cottage rushing to his door, and begging him in
Heaven&rsquo;s name to come down to the assistance of her
mistress.</p>
<p>When Morton left her, Anastasia did not proceed to do as she
had said, and seemed to have forgotten her evening meal.&nbsp;
She had been working sedulously with her needle during all that
last conversation; but when her lover was gone, she allowed the
work to fall from her hands, and sat motionless for awhile,
gazing at the last streak of colour left by the setting sun; but
there was no longer a sign of its glory to be traced in the
heavens around her.&nbsp; The twilight in Bermuda is not long and
enduring as it is with us, though the daylight does not depart
suddenly, leaving the darkness of night behind it without any
intermediate time of warning, as is the case farther south, down
among the islands of the tropics.&nbsp; But the soft, sweet light
of the evening had waned and gone, and night had absolutely come
upon her, while Anastasia was still seated before the cottage
with her eyes fixed upon the white streak of motionless sea which
was still visible through the gloom.&nbsp; She was thinking of
him, of his ways of life, of his happiness, and of her duty
towards him.&nbsp; She had told him, with her pretty feminine
falseness, that she could wait without impatience; but now she
said to herself that it would not be good for him to wait
longer.&nbsp; He lived alone and without comfort, working very
hard for his poor pittance, and she could see, and feel, and
understand that a companion in his life was to him almost a
necessity.&nbsp; She would tell her father that all this must be
brought to an end.&nbsp; She would not ask him for money, but she
would make him understand that her services must, at any rate in
part, be transferred.&nbsp; Why should not she and Morton still
live at the cottage when they were married?&nbsp; And so
thinking, and at last resolving, she sat there till the dark
night fell upon her.</p>
<p>She was at last disturbed by feeling a man&rsquo;s hand upon
her shoulder.&nbsp; She jumped from her chair and faced
him,&mdash;not screaming, for it was especially within her power
to control herself, and to make no utterance except with
forethought.&nbsp; Perhaps it might have been better for her had
she screamed, and sent a shrill shriek down the shore of that
inland sea.&nbsp; She was silent, however, and with awe-struck
face and outstretched hands gazed into the face of him who still
held her by the shoulder.&nbsp; The night was dark; but her eyes
were now accustomed to the darkness, and she could see
indistinctly something of his features.&nbsp; He was a low-sized
man, dressed in a suit of sailor&rsquo;s blue clothing, with a
rough cap of hair on his head, and a beard that had not been
clipped for many weeks.&nbsp; His eyes were large, and hollow,
and frightfully bright, so that she seemed to see nothing else of
him; but she felt the strength of his fingers as he grasped her
tighter and more tightly by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she said, after a moment&rsquo;s
pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know you!&nbsp; No.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the words were
hardly out of her mouth before it struck her that the man was
Aaron Trow, of whom every one in Bermuda had been talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come into the house,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and give me
food.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he still held her with his hand as though
he would compel her to follow him.</p>
<p>She stood for a moment thinking what she would say to him; for
even then, with that terrible man standing close to her in the
darkness, her presence of mind did not desert her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will give you food if
you are hungry.&nbsp; But take your hand from me.&nbsp; No man
would lay his hands on a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman!&rdquo; said the stranger.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
does the starved wolf care for that?&nbsp; A woman&rsquo;s blood
is as sweet to him as that of a man.&nbsp; Come into the house, I
tell you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then she preceded him through the open
door into the narrow passage, and thence to the kitchen.&nbsp;
There she saw that the back door, leading out on the other side
of the house, was open, and she knew that he had come down from
the road and entered on that side.&nbsp; She threw her eyes
around, looking for the negro girls; but they were away, and she
remembered that there was no human being within sound of her
voice but this man who had told her that he was as a wolf thirsty
after her blood!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me food at once,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will you go if I give it you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will knock out your brains if you do not,&rdquo; he
replied, lifting from the grate a short, thick poker which lay
there.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do as I bid you at once.&nbsp; You also would
be like a tiger if you had fasted for two days, as I have
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could see, as she moved across the kitchen, that he had
already searched there for something that he might eat, but that
he had searched in vain.&nbsp; With the close economy common
among his class in the islands, all comestibles were kept under
close lock and key in the house of Mr. Bergen.&nbsp; Their daily
allowance was given day by day to the negro servants, and even
the fragments were then gathered up and locked away in
safety.&nbsp; She moved across the kitchen to the accustomed
cupboard, taking the keys from her pocket, and he followed close
upon her.&nbsp; There was a small oil lamp hanging from the low
ceiling which just gave them light to see each other.&nbsp; She
lifted her hand to this to take it from its hook, but he
prevented her.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, by Heaven!&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t touch that till I&rsquo;ve done with
it.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s light enough for you to drag out your
scraps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did drag out her scraps and a bowl of milk, which might
hold perhaps a quart.&nbsp; There was a fragment of bread, a
morsel of cold potato-cake, and the bone of a leg of kid.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And is that all?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; But as he spoke he
fleshed his teeth against the bone as a dog would have done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the best I have,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I wish
it were better, and you should have had it without violence, as
you have suffered so long from hunger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&nbsp; Better; yes!&nbsp; You would give the best
no doubt, and set the hell hounds on my track the moment I am
gone.&nbsp; I know how much I might expect from your
charity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would have fed you for pity&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; she
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity!&nbsp; Who are you, that you should dare to pity
me!&nbsp; By &mdash;, my young woman, it is I that pity
you.&nbsp; I must cut your throat unless you give me money.&nbsp;
Do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money!&nbsp; I have got no money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make you have some before I go.&nbsp; Come;
don&rsquo;t move till I have done.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as he spoke
to her he went on tugging at the bone, and swallowing the lumps
of stale bread.&nbsp; He had already finished the bowl of
milk.&nbsp; &ldquo;And, now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;tell me who I
am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you are Aaron Trow,&rdquo; she answered, very
slowly.&nbsp; He said nothing on hearing this, but continued his
meal, standing close to her so that she might not possibly escape
from him out into the darkness.&nbsp; Twice or thrice in those
few minutes she made up her mind to make such an attempt, feeling
that it would be better to leave him in possession of the house,
and make sure, if possible, of her own life.&nbsp; There was no
money there; not a dollar!&nbsp; What money her father kept in
his possession was locked up in his safe at Hamilton.&nbsp; And
might he not keep to his threat, and murder her, when he found
that she could give him nothing?&nbsp; She did not tremble
outwardly, as she stood there watching him as he ate, but she
thought how probable it might be that her last moments were very
near.&nbsp; And yet she could scrutinise his features, form, and
garments, so as to carry away in her mind a perfect picture of
them.&nbsp; Aaron Trow&mdash;for of course it was the escaped
convict&mdash;was not a man of frightful, hideous aspect.&nbsp;
Had the world used him well, giving him when he was young ample
wages and separating him from turbulent spirits, he also might
have used the world well; and then women would have praised the
brightness of his eye and the manly vigour of his brow.&nbsp; But
things had not gone well with him.&nbsp; He had been separated
from the wife he had loved, and the children who had been raised
at his knee,&mdash;separated by his own violence; and now, as he
had said of himself, he was a wolf rather than a man.&nbsp; As he
stood there satisfying the craving of his appetite, breaking up
the large morsels of food, he was an object very sad to be
seen.&nbsp; Hunger had made him gaunt and yellow, he was squalid
with the dirt of his hidden lair, and he had the look of a
beast;&mdash;that look to which men fall when they live like the
brutes of prey, as outcasts from their brethren.&nbsp; But still
there was that about his brow which might have redeemed
him,&mdash;which might have turned her horror into pity, had he
been willing that it should be so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now give me some brandy,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>There was brandy in the house,&mdash;in the sitting-room which
was close at their hand, and the key of the little press which
held it was in her pocket.&nbsp; It was useless, she thought, to
refuse him; and so she told him that there was a bottle partly
full, but that she must go to the next room to fetch it him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go together, my darling,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like good
company.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he again put his hand upon her arm as
they passed into the family sitting-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must take the light,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; But he
unhooked it himself, and carried it in his own hand.</p>
<p>Again she went to work without trembling.&nbsp; She found the
key of the side cupboard, and unlocking the door, handed him a
bottle which might contain about half-a-pint of spirits.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And is that all?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a full bottle here,&rdquo; she answered,
handing him another; &ldquo;but if you drink it, you will be
drunk, and they will catch you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Heavens, yes; and you would be the first to help
them; would you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you
will go now, I will not say a word to any one of your coming, nor
set them on your track to follow you.&nbsp; There, take the full
bottle with you.&nbsp; If you will go, you shall be safe from
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, and go without money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have none to give you.&nbsp; You may believe me when
I say so.&nbsp; I have not a dollar in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he spoke again he raised the half empty bottle to his
mouth, and drank as long as there was a drop to drink.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said he, putting the bottle down, &ldquo;I
am better after that.&nbsp; As to the other, you are right, and I
will take it with me.&nbsp; And now, young woman, about the
money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you that I have not a dollar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said he, and he spoke now in a softer
voice, as though he would be on friendly terms with her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Give me ten sovereigns, and I will go.&nbsp; I know you
have it, and with ten sovereigns it is possible that I may save
my life.&nbsp; You are good, and would not wish that a man should
die so horrid a death.&nbsp; I know you are good.&nbsp; Come,
give me the money.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he put his hands up,
beseeching her, and looked into her face with imploring eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the word of a Christian woman I have not got money
to give you,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;&nbsp; And as he spoke he took her by
the arm and shook her.&nbsp; He shook her violently so that he
hurt her, and her breath for a moment was all but gone from
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tell you you must make dollars before I leave
you, or I will so handle you that it would have been better for
you to coin your very blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May God help me at my need,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;as
I have not above a few penny pieces in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you expect me to believe that!&nbsp; Look
here!&nbsp; I will shake the teeth out of your head, but I will
have it from you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he did shake her again, using
both his hands and striking her against the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you&mdash;murder me?&rdquo; she said, hardly able
now to utter the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murder you, yes; why not?&nbsp; I cannot be worse than
I am, were I to murder you ten times over.&nbsp; But with money I
may possibly be better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will do worse than murder you.&nbsp; I will make
you such an object that all the world shall loathe to look on
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so saying he took her by the arm and
dragged her forth from the wall against which she had stood.</p>
<p>Then there came from her a shriek that was heard far down the
shore of that silent sea, and away across to the solitary houses
of those living on the other side,&mdash;a shriek, very sad,
sharp, and prolonged,&mdash;which told plainly to those who heard
it of woman&rsquo;s woe when in her extremest peril.&nbsp; That
sound was spoken of in Bermuda for many a day after that, as
something which had been terrible to hear.&nbsp; But then, at
that moment, as it came wailing through the dark, it sounded as
though it were not human.&nbsp; Of those who heard it, not one
guessed from whence it came, nor was the hand of any brother put
forward to help that woman at her need.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear that?&rdquo; said the young wife to her
husband, from the far side of the arm of the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear it!&nbsp; Oh Heaven, yes!&nbsp; Whence did it
come?&rdquo;&nbsp; The young wife could not say from whence it
came, but clung close to her husband&rsquo;s breast, comforting
herself with the knowledge that that terrible sorrow was not
hers.</p>
<p>But aid did come at last, or rather that which seemed as
aid.&nbsp; Long and terrible was the fight between that human
beast of prey and the poor victim which had fallen into his
talons.&nbsp; Anastasia Bergen was a strong, well-built woman,
and now that the time had come to her when a struggle was
necessary, a struggle for life, for honour, for the happiness of
him who was more to her than herself, she fought like a tigress
attacked in her own lair.&nbsp; At such a moment as this she also
could become wild and savage as the beast of the forest.&nbsp;
When he pinioned her arms with one of his, as he pressed her down
upon the floor, she caught the first joint of the forefinger of
his other hand between her teeth till he yelled in agony, and
another sound was heard across the silent water.&nbsp; And then,
when one hand was loosed in the struggle, she twisted it through
his long hair, and dragged back his head till his eyes were
nearly starting from their sockets.&nbsp; Anastasia Bergen had
hitherto been a sheer woman, all feminine in her nature.&nbsp;
But now the foam came to her mouth, and fire sprang from her
eyes, and the muscles of her body worked as though she had been
trained to deeds of violence.&nbsp; Of violence, Aaron Trow had
known much in his rough life, but never had he combated with
harder antagonist than her whom he now held beneath his
breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By&mdash;I will put an end to you,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
in his wrath, as he struck her violently across the face with his
elbow.&nbsp; His hand was occupied, and he could not use it for a
blow, but, nevertheless, the violence was so great that the blood
gushed from her nostrils, while the back of her head was driven
with violence against the floor.&nbsp; But she did not lose her
hold of him.&nbsp; Her hand was still twined closely through his
thick hair, and in every move he made she clung to him with all
her might.&nbsp; &ldquo;Leave go my hair,&rdquo; he shouted at
her, but she still kept her hold, though he again dashed her head
against the floor.</p>
<p>There was still light in the room, for when he first grasped
her with both his hands, he had put the lamp down on a small
table.&nbsp; Now they were rolling on the floor together, and
twice he had essayed to kneel on her that he might thus crush the
breath from her body, and deprive her altogether of her strength;
but she had been too active for him, moving herself along the
ground, though in doing so she dragged him with her.&nbsp; But by
degrees he got one hand at liberty, and with that he pulled a
clasp knife out of his pocket and opened it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will
cut your head off if you do not let go my hair,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; But still she held fast by him.&nbsp; He then stabbed
at her arm, using his left hand and making short, ineffectual
blows.&nbsp; Her dress partly saved her, and partly also the
continual movement of all her limbs; but, nevertheless, the knife
wounded her.&nbsp; It wounded her in several places about the
arm, covering them both with blood;&mdash;but still she hung
on.&nbsp; So close was her grasp in her agony, that, as she
afterwards found, she cut the skin of her own hands with her own
nails.&nbsp; Had the man&rsquo;s hair been less thick or strong,
or her own tenacity less steadfast, he would have murdered her
before any interruption could have saved her.</p>
<p>And yet he had not purposed to murder her, or even, in the
first instance, to inflict on her any bodily harm.&nbsp; But he
had been determined to get money.&nbsp; With such a sum of money
as he had named, it might, he thought, be possible for him to win
his way across to America.&nbsp; He might bribe men to hide him
in the hold of a ship, and thus there might be for him, at any
rate, a possibility of escape.&nbsp; That there must be money in
the house he had still thought when first he laid hands on the
poor woman; and then, when the struggle had once begun, when he
had felt her muscles contending with his, the passion of the
beast was aroused within him, and he strove against her as he
would have striven against a dog.&nbsp; But yet, when the knife
was in his hand, he had not driven it against her heart.</p>
<p>Then suddenly, while they were yet rolling on the floor, there
was a sound of footsteps in the passage.&nbsp; Aaron Trow
instantly leaped to his feet, leaving his victim on the ground,
with huge lumps of his thick clotted hair in her hand.&nbsp;
Thus, and thus only, could he have liberated himself from her
grasp.&nbsp; He rushed at the door, and there he came against the
two negro servant-girls who had returned down to their kitchen
from the road on which they had been straying.&nbsp; Trow, as he
half saw them in the dark, not knowing how many there might be,
or whether there was a man among them, rushed through them,
upsetting one scared girl in his passage.&nbsp; With the instinct
and with the timidity of a beast, his impulse now was to escape,
and he hurried away back to the road and to his lair, leaving the
three women together in the cottage.&nbsp; Poor wretch!&nbsp; As
he crossed the road, not skulking in his impotent haste, but
running at his best, another pair of eyes saw him, and when the
search became hot after him, it was known that his hiding-place
was not distant.</p>
<p>It was some time before any of the women were able to act, and
when some step was taken, Anastasia was the first to take
it.&nbsp; She had not absolutely swooned, but the reaction, after
the violence of her efforts, was so great, that for some minutes
she had been unable to speak.&nbsp; She had risen from the floor
when Trow left her, and had even followed him to the door; but
since that she had fallen back into her father&rsquo;s old
arm-chair, and there sat gasping not only for words, but for
breath also.</p>
<p>At last she bade one of the girls to run into St. George, and
beg Mr. Morton to come to her aid.&nbsp; The girl would not stir
without her companion; and even then, Anastasia, covered as she
was with blood, with dishevelled hair, and her clothes half torn
from her body, accompanied them as far as the road.&nbsp; There
they found a negro lad still hanging about the place, and he told
them that he had seen the man cross the road, and run down over
the open ground towards the rocks of the sea-coast.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He must be there,&rdquo; said the lad, pointing in the
direction of a corner of the rocks; &ldquo;unless he swim across
the mouth of the ferry.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the mouth of that ferry
is an arm of the sea, and it was not probable that a man would do
that when he might have taken the narrow water by keeping on the
other side of the road.</p>
<p>At about one that night Caleb Morton reached the cottage
breathless with running, and before a word was spoken between
them, Anastasia had fallen on his shoulder and had fainted.&nbsp;
As soon as she was in the arms of her lover, all her power had
gone from her.&nbsp; The spirit and passion of the tiger had
gone, and she was again a weak woman shuddering at the thought of
what she had suffered.&nbsp; She remembered that she had had the
man&rsquo;s hand between her teeth, and by degrees she found his
hair still clinging to her fingers; but even then she could
hardly call to mind the nature of the struggle she had
undergone.&nbsp; His hot breath close to her own cheek she did
remember, and his glaring eyes, and even the roughness of his
beard as he pressed his face against her own; but she could not
say whence had come the blood, nor till her arm became stiff and
motionless did she know that she had been wounded.</p>
<p>It was all joy with her now, as she sat motionless without
speaking, while he administered to her wants and spoke words of
love into her ears.&nbsp; She remembered the man&rsquo;s horrid
threat, and knew that by God&rsquo;s mercy she had been
saved.&nbsp; And he was there caressing her, loving her,
comforting her!&nbsp; As she thought of the fate that had
threatened her, of the evil that had been so imminent, she fell
forward on her knees, and with incoherent sobs uttered her
thanksgivings, while her head was still supported on his
arms.</p>
<p>It was almost morning before she could induce herself to leave
him and lie down.&nbsp; With him she seemed to be so perfectly
safe; but the moment he was away she could see Aaron Trow&rsquo;s
eyes gleaming at her across the room.&nbsp; At last, however, she
slept; and when he saw that she was at rest, he told himself that
his work must then begin.&nbsp; Hitherto Caleb Morton had lived
in all respects the life of a man of peace; but now, asking
himself no questions as to the propriety of what he would do,
using no inward arguments as to this or that line of conduct, he
girded the sword on his loins, and prepared himself for
war.&nbsp; The wretch who had thus treated the woman whom he
loved should be hunted down like a wild beast, as long as he had
arms and legs with which to carry on the hunt.&nbsp; He would
pursue the miscreant with any weapons that might come to his
hands; and might Heaven help him at his need as he dealt forth
punishment to that man, if he caught him within his grasp.&nbsp;
Those who had hitherto known Morton in the island, could not
recognise the man as he came forth on that day, thirsty after
blood, and desirous to thrust himself into personal conflict with
the wild ruffian who had injured him.&nbsp; The meek Presbyterian
minister had been a preacher, preaching ways of peace, and living
in accordance with his own doctrines.&nbsp; The world had been
very quiet for him, and he had walked quietly in his appointed
path.&nbsp; But now the world was quiet no longer, nor was there
any preaching of peace.&nbsp; His cry was for blood; for the
blood of the untamed savage brute who had come upon his young doe
in her solitude, and striven with such brutal violence to tear
her heart from her bosom.</p>
<p>He got to his assistance early in the morning some of the
constables from St. George, and before the day was over, he was
joined by two or three of the warders from the convict
establishment.&nbsp; There was with him also a friend or two, and
thus a party was formed, numbering together ten or twelve
persons.&nbsp; They were of course all armed, and therefore it
might be thought that there would be but small chance for the
wretched man if they should come upon his track.&nbsp; At first
they all searched together, thinking from the tidings which had
reached them that he must be near to them; but gradually they
spread themselves along the rocks between St. George and the
ferry, keeping watchman on the road, so that he should not escape
unnoticed into the island.</p>
<p>Ten times during the day did Anastasia send from the cottage
up to Morton, begging him to leave the search to others, and come
down to her.&nbsp; But not for a moment would he lose the scent
of his prey.&nbsp; What! should it be said that she had been so
treated, and that others had avenged her?&nbsp; He sent back to
say that her father was with her now, and that he would come when
his work was over.&nbsp; And in that job of work the life-blood
of Aaron Trow was counted up.</p>
<p>Towards evening they were all congregated on the road near to
the spot at which the path turns off towards the cottage, when a
voice was heard hallooing to them from the summit of a little
hill which lies between the road and the sea on the side towards
the ferry, and presently a boy came running down to them full of
news.&nbsp; &ldquo;Danny Lund has seen him,&rdquo; said the boy,
&ldquo;he has seen him plainly in among the rocks.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And then came Danny Lund himself, a small negro lad about
fourteen years of age, who was known in those parts as the
idlest, most dishonest, and most useless of his race.&nbsp; On
this occasion, however, Danny Lund became important, and every
one listened to him.&nbsp; He had seen, he said, a pair of eyes
moving down in a cave of the rocks which he well knew.&nbsp; He
had been in the cave often, he said, and could get there
again.&nbsp; But not now; not while that pair of eyes was moving
at the bottom of it.&nbsp; And so they all went up over the hill,
Morton leading the way with hot haste.&nbsp; In his waist-band he
held a pistol, and his hand grasped a short iron bar with which
he had armed himself.&nbsp; They ascended the top of the hill,
and when there, the open sea was before them on two sides, and on
the third was the narrow creek over which the ferry passed.&nbsp;
Immediately beneath their feet were the broken rocks; for on that
side, towards the sea, the earth and grass of the hill descended
but a little way towards the water.&nbsp; Down among the rocks
they all went, silently, Caleb Morton leading the way, and Danny
Lund directing him from behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Morton,&rdquo; said an elderly man from St. George,
&ldquo;had you not better let the warders of the gaol go first;
he is a desperate man, and they will best understand his
ways?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In answer to this Morton said nothing, but he would let no one
put a foot before him.&nbsp; He still pressed forward among the
rocks, and at last came to a spot from whence he might have
sprung at one leap into the ocean.&nbsp; It was a broken cranny
on the sea-shore into which the sea beat, and surrounded on every
side but the one by huge broken fragments of stone, which at
first sight seemed as though they would have admitted of a path
down among them to the water&rsquo;s edge; but which, when
scanned more closely, were seen to be so large in size, that no
man could climb from one to another.&nbsp; It was a singularly
romantic spot, but now well known to them all there, for they had
visited it over and over again that morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In there,&rdquo; said Danny Lund, keeping well behind
Morton&rsquo;s body, and pointing at the same time to a cavern
high up among the rocks, but quite on the opposite side of the
little inlet of the sea.&nbsp; The mouth of the cavern was not
twenty yards from where they stood, but at the first sight it
seemed as though it must be impossible to reach it.&nbsp; The
precipice on the brink of which they all now stood, ran down
sheer into the sea, and the fall from the mouth of the cavern on
the other side was as steep.&nbsp; But Danny solved the mystery
by pointing upwards, and showing them how he had been used to
climb to a projecting rock over their heads, and from thence
creep round by certain vantages of the stone till he was able to
let himself down into the aperture.&nbsp; But now, at the present
moment, he was unwilling to make essay of his prowess as a
cragsman.&nbsp; He had, he said, been up on that projecting rock
thrice, and there had seen the eyes moving in the cavern.&nbsp;
He was quite sure of that fact of the pair of eyes, and declined
to ascend the rock again.</p>
<p>Traces soon became visible to them by which they knew that
some one had passed in and out of the cavern recently.&nbsp; The
stone, when examined, bore those marks of friction which passage
and repassage over it will always give.&nbsp; At the spot from
whence the climber left the platform and commenced his ascent,
the side of the stone had been rubbed by the close friction of a
man&rsquo;s body.&nbsp; A light boy like Danny Lund might find
his way in and out without leaving such marks behind him, but no
heavy man could do so.&nbsp; Thus before long they all were
satisfied that Aaron Trow was in the cavern before them.</p>
<p>Then there was a long consultation as to what they would do to
carry on the hunt, and how they would drive the tiger from his
lair.&nbsp; That he should not again come out, except to fall
into their hands, was to all of them a matter of course.&nbsp;
They would keep watch and ward there, though it might be for days
and nights.&nbsp; But that was a process which did not satisfy
Morton, and did not indeed well satisfy any of them.&nbsp; It was
not only that they desired to inflict punishment on the miscreant
in accordance with the law, but also that they did not desire
that the miserable man should die in a hole like a starved dog,
and that then they should go after him to take out his wretched
skeleton.&nbsp; There was something in that idea so horrid in
every way, that all agreed that active steps must be taken.&nbsp;
The warders of the prison felt that they would all be disgraced
if they could not take their prisoner alive.&nbsp; Yet who would
get round that perilous ledge in the face of such an
adversary?&nbsp; A touch to any man while climbing there would
send him headlong down among the wave!&nbsp; And then his fancy
told to each what might be the nature of an embrace with such an
animal as that, driven to despair, hopeless of life, armed, as
they knew, at any rate, with a knife!&nbsp; If the first
adventurous spirit should succeed in crawling round that ledge,
what would be the reception which he might expect in the terrible
depth of that cavern?</p>
<p>They called to their prisoner, bidding him come out, and
telling him that they would fire in upon him if he did not show
himself; but not a sound was heard.&nbsp; It was indeed possible
that they should send their bullets to, perhaps, every corner of
the cavern; and if so, in that way they might slaughter him; but
even of this they were not sure.&nbsp; Who could tell that there
might not be some protected nook in which he could lay
secure?&nbsp; And who could tell when the man was struck, or
whether he were wounded?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will get to him,&rdquo; said Morton, speaking with a
low dogged voice, and so saying he clambered up to the rock to
which Danny Lund had pointed.&nbsp; Many voices at once attempted
to restrain him, and one or two put their hands upon him to keep
him back, but he was too quick for them, and now stood upon the
ledge of rock.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can you see him?&rdquo; they asked
below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see nothing within the cavern,&rdquo; said
Morton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look down very hard, Massa,&rdquo; said Danny,
&ldquo;very hard indeed, down in deep dark hole, and then see him
big eyes moving!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morton now crept along the ledge, or rather he was beginning
to do so, having put forward his shoulders and arms to make a
first step in advance from the spot on which he was resting, when
a hand was put forth from one corner of the cavern&rsquo;s
mouth,&mdash;a hand armed with a pistol;&mdash;and a shot was
fired.&nbsp; There could be no doubt now but that Danny Lund was
right, and no doubt now as to the whereabouts of Aaron Trow.</p>
<p>A hand was put forth, a pistol was fired, and Caleb Morton
still clinging to a corner of the rock with both his arms was
seen to falter.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is wounded,&rdquo; said one of
the voices from below; and then they all expected to see him fall
into the sea.&nbsp; But he did not fall, and after a moment or
two, he proceeded carefully to pick his steps along the
ledge.&nbsp; The ball had touched him, grazing his cheek, and
cutting through the light whiskers that he wore; but he had not
felt it, though the blow had nearly knocked him from his
perch.&nbsp; And then four or five shots were fired from the
rocks into the mouth of the cavern.&nbsp; The man&rsquo;s arm had
been seen, and indeed one or two declared that they had traced
the dim outline of his figure.&nbsp; But no sound was heard to
come from the cavern, except the sharp crack of the bullets
against the rock, and the echo of the gunpowder.&nbsp; There had
been no groan as of a man wounded, no sound of a body falling, no
voice wailing in despair.&nbsp; For a few seconds all was dark
with the smoke of the gunpowder, and then the empty mouth of the
cave was again yawning before their eyes.&nbsp; Morton was now
near it, still cautiously creeping.&nbsp; The first danger to
which he was exposed was this; that his enemy within the recess
might push him down from the rocks with a touch.&nbsp; But on the
other hand, there were three or four men ready to fire, the
moment that a hand should be put forth; and then Morton could
swim,&mdash;was known to be a strong swimmer;&mdash;whereas of
Aaron Trow it was already declared by the prison gaolers that he
could not swim.&nbsp; Two of the warders had now followed Morton
on the rocks, so that in the event of his making good his
entrance into the cavern, and holding his enemy at bay for a
minute, he would be joined by aid.</p>
<p>It was strange to see how those different men conducted
themselves as they stood on the opposite platform watching the
attack.&nbsp; The officers from the prison had no other thought
but of their prisoner, and were intent on taking him alive or
dead.&nbsp; To them it was little or nothing what became of
Morton.&nbsp; It was their business to encounter peril, and they
were ready to do so;&mdash;feeling, however, by no means sorry to
have such a man as Morton in advance of them.&nbsp; Very little
was said by them.&nbsp; They had their wits about them, and
remembered that every word spoken for the guidance of their ally
would be heard also by the escaped convict.&nbsp; Their prey was
sure, sooner or later, and had not Morton been so eager in his
pursuit, they would have waited till some plan had been devised
of trapping him without danger.&nbsp; But the townsmen from St.
George, of whom some dozen were now standing there, were quick
and eager and loud in their counsels.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stay where you
are, Mr. Morton,&mdash;stay awhile for the love of God&mdash;or
he&rsquo;ll have you down.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Now&rsquo;s your
time, Caleb; in on him now, and you&rsquo;ll have
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Close with him, Morton, close with him
at once; it&rsquo;s your only chance.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s four of us here; we&rsquo;ll fire on him if
he as much as shows a limb.&rdquo;&nbsp; All of which words as
they were heard by that poor wretch within, must have sounded to
him as the barking of a pack of hounds thirsting for his
blood.&nbsp; For him at any rate there was no longer any hope in
this world.</p>
<p>My reader, when chance has taken you into the hunting-field,
has it ever been your lot to sit by on horseback, and watch the
digging out of a fox?&nbsp; The operation is not an uncommon one,
and in some countries it is held to be in accordance with the
rules of fair sport.&nbsp; For myself, I think that when the
brute has so far saved himself, he should be entitled to the
benefit of his cunning; but I will not now discuss the propriety
or impropriety of that practice in venery.&nbsp; I can never,
however, watch the doing of that work without thinking much of
the agonising struggles of the poor beast whose last refuge is
being torn from over his head.&nbsp; There he lies within a few
yards of his arch enemy, the huntsman.&nbsp; The thick breath of
the hounds make hot the air within his hole.&nbsp; The sound of
their voices is close upon his ears.&nbsp; His breast is nearly
bursting with the violence of that effort which at last has
brought him to his retreat.&nbsp; And then pickaxe and mattock
are plied above his head, and nearer and more near to him press
his foes,&mdash;his double foes, human and canine,&mdash;till at
last a huge hand grasps him, and he is dragged forth among his
enemies.&nbsp; Almost as soon as his eyes have seen the light the
eager noses of a dozen hounds have moistened themselves in his
entrails.&nbsp; Ah me!&nbsp; I know that he is vermin, the vermin
after whom I have been risking my neck, with a bold ambition that
I might ultimately witness his death-struggles; but,
nevertheless, I would fain have saved him that last half hour of
gradually diminished hope.</p>
<p>And Aaron Trow was now like a hunted fox, doomed to be dug out
from his last refuge, with this addition to his misery, that
these hounds when they caught their prey, would not put him at
once out of his misery.&nbsp; When first he saw that throng of
men coming down from the hill top and resting on the platform; he
knew that his fate was come.&nbsp; When they called to him to
surrender himself he was silent, but he knew that his silence was
of no avail.&nbsp; To them who were so eager to be his captors
the matter seemed to be still one of considerable difficulty;
but, to his thinking, there was no difficulty.&nbsp; There were
there some score of men, fully armed, within twenty yards of
him.&nbsp; If he but showed a trace of his limbs he would become
a mark for their bullets.&nbsp; And then if he were wounded, and
no one would come to him!&nbsp; If they allowed him to lie there
without food till he perished!&nbsp; Would it not be well for him
to yield himself?&nbsp; Then they called again and he was still
silent.&nbsp; That idea of yielding is very terrible to the heart
of a man.&nbsp; And when the worst had come to the worst, did not
the ocean run deep beneath his cavern&rsquo;s month?</p>
<p>But as they yelled at him and hallooed, making their
preparations for his death, his presence of mind deserted the
poor wretch.&nbsp; He had stolen an old pistol on one of his
marauding expeditions, of which one barrel had been loaded.&nbsp;
That in his mad despair he had fired; and now, as he lay near the
mouth of the cavern, under the cover of the projecting stone, he
had no weapon with him but his hands.&nbsp; He had had a knife,
but that had dropped from him during the struggle on the floor of
the cottage.&nbsp; He had now nothing but his hands, and was
considering how he might best use them in ridding himself of the
first of his pursuers.&nbsp; The man was near him, armed, with
all the power and majesty of right on his side; whereas on his
side, Aaron Trow had nothing,&mdash;not a hope.&nbsp; He raised
his head that he might look forth, and a dozen voices shouted as
his face appeared above the aperture.&nbsp; A dozen weapons were
levelled at him, and he could see the gleaming of the muzzles of
the guns.&nbsp; And then the foot of his pursuer was already on
the corner stone at the cavern&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now,
Caleb, on him at once!&rdquo; shouted a voice.&nbsp; Ah me! it
was a moment in which to pity even such a man as Aaron Trow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Caleb, at him at once!&rdquo; shouted the
voice.&nbsp; No, by heavens; not so, even yet!&nbsp; The sound of
triumph in those words raised the last burst of energy in the
breast of that wretched man; and he sprang forth, head foremost,
from his prison house.&nbsp; Forth he came, manifest enough
before the eyes of them all, and with head well down, and hands
outstretched, but with his wide glaring eyes still turned towards
his pursuers as he fell, he plunged down into the waves beneath
him.&nbsp; Two of those who stood by, almost unconscious of what
they did, fired at his body as it made its rapid way to the
water; but, as they afterwards found, neither of the bullets
struck him.&nbsp; Morton, when his prey thus leaped forth,
escaping him for awhile, was already on the verge of the
cavern,&mdash;had even then prepared his foot for that onward
spring which should bring him to the throat of his foe.&nbsp; But
he arrested himself, and for a moment stood there watching the
body as it struck the water, and hid itself at once beneath the
ripple.&nbsp; He stood there for a moment watching the deed and
its effect, and then leaving his hold upon the rock, he once
again followed his quarry.&nbsp; Down he went, head foremost,
right on to the track in the waves which the other had made; and
when the two rose to the surface together, each was struggling in
the grasp of the other.</p>
<p>It was a foolish, nay, a mad deed to do.&nbsp; The poor wretch
who had first fallen could not have escaped.&nbsp; He could not
even swim, and had therefore flung himself to certain destruction
when he took that leap from out of the cavern&rsquo;s
mouth.&nbsp; It would have been sad to see him perish beneath the
waves,&mdash;to watch him as he rose, gasping for breath, and
then to see to him sinking again, to rise again, and then to go
for ever.&nbsp; But his life had been fairly forfeit,&mdash;and
why should one so much more precious have been flung after
it?&nbsp; It was surely with no view of saving that pitiful life
that Caleb Morton had leaped after his enemy.&nbsp; But the
hound, hot with the chase, will follow the stag over the
precipice and dash himself to pieces against the rocks.&nbsp; The
beast thirsting for blood will rush in even among the weapons of
men.&nbsp; Morton in his fury had felt but one desire, burned
with but one passion.&nbsp; If the Fates would but grant him to
fix his clutches in the throat of the man who had ill-used his
love; for the rest it might all go as it would.</p>
<p>In the earlier part of the morning, while they were all
searching for their victim, they had brought a boat up into this
very inlet among the rocks; and the same boat had been at hand
during the whole day.&nbsp; Unluckily, before they had come
hither, it had been taken round the headland to a place among the
rocks at which a government skiff is always moored.&nbsp; The sea
was still so quiet that there was hardly a ripple on it, and the
boat had been again sent for when first it was supposed that they
had at last traced Aaron Trow to his hiding-place.&nbsp;
Anxiously now were all eyes turned to the headland, but as yet no
boat was there.</p>
<p>The two men rose to the surface, each struggling in the arms
of the other.&nbsp; Trow, though he was in an element to which he
was not used, though he had sprung thither as another suicide
might spring to certain death beneath a railway engine, did not
altogether lose his presence of mind.&nbsp; Prompted by a double
instinct, he had clutched hold of Morton&rsquo;s body when he
encountered it beneath the waters.&nbsp; He held on to it, as to
his only protection, and he held on to him also as to his only
enemy.&nbsp; If there was a chance for a life struggle, they
would share that chance together; and if not, then together would
they meet that other fate.</p>
<p>Caleb Morton was a very strong man, and though one of his arms
was altogether encumbered by his antagonist, his other arm and
his legs were free.&nbsp; With these he seemed to succeed in
keeping his head above the water, weighted as he was with the
body of his foe.&nbsp; But Trow&rsquo;s efforts were also used
with the view of keeping himself above the water.&nbsp; Though he
had purposed to destroy himself in taking that leap, and now
hoped for nothing better than that they might both perish
together, he yet struggled to keep his head above the
waves.&nbsp; Bodily power he had none left to him, except that of
holding on to Morton&rsquo;s arm and plunging with his legs; but
he did hold on, and thus both their heads remained above the
surface.</p>
<p>But this could not last long.&nbsp; It was easy to see that
Trow&rsquo;s strength was nearly spent, and that when he went
down Morton must go with him.&nbsp; If indeed they could be
separated,&mdash;if Morton could once make himself free from that
embrace into which he had been so anxious to leap,&mdash;then
indeed there might be a hope.&nbsp; All round that little inlet
the rock fell sheer down into the deep sea, so that there was no
resting-place for a foot; it but round the headlands on either
side, even within forty or fifty yards of that spot, Morton might
rest on the rocks, till a boat should come to his
assistance.&nbsp; To him that distance would have been nothing,
if only his limbs had been at liberty.</p>
<p>Upon the platform of rocks they were all at their wits&rsquo;
ends.&nbsp; Many were anxious to fire at Trow; but even if they
hit him, would Morton&rsquo;s position have been better?&nbsp;
Would not the wounded man have still clung to him who was not
wounded?&nbsp; And then there could be no certainty that any one
of them would hit the right man.&nbsp; The ripple of the waves,
though it was very slight, nevertheless sufficed to keep the
bodies in motion; and then, too, there was not among them any
marksman peculiar for his skill.</p>
<p>Morton&rsquo;s efforts in the water were too severe to admit
of his speaking, but he could hear and understand the words which
were addressed to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shake him off,
Caleb.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Strike him from you with your
foot.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Swim to the right shore; swim for it,
even if you take him with you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes; he could hear
them all; but hearing and obeying were very different.&nbsp; It
was not easy to shake off that dying man; and as for swimming
with him, that was clearly impossible.&nbsp; It was as much as he
could do to keep his head above water, let alone any attempt to
move in one settled direction.</p>
<p>For some four or five minutes they lay thus battling on the
waves before the head of either of them went down.&nbsp; Trow had
been twice below the surface, but it was before he had succeeded
in supporting himself by Morton&rsquo;s arm.&nbsp; Now it seemed
as though he must sink again,&mdash;as though both must
sink.&nbsp; His mouth was barely kept above the water, and as
Morton shook him with his arm, the tide would pass over
him.&nbsp; It was horrid to watch from the shore the glaring
upturned eyes of the dying wretch, as his long streaming hair lay
back upon the wave.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, Caleb, hold him down.&nbsp;
Hold him under,&rdquo; was shouted in the voice of some eager
friend.&nbsp; Rising up on the water, Morton made a last effort
to do as he was bid.&nbsp; He did press the man&rsquo;s head
down,&mdash;well down below the surface,&mdash;but still the hand
clung to him, and as he struck out against the water, he was
powerless against that grasp.</p>
<p>Then there came a loud shout along the shore, and all those on
the platform, whose eyes had been fixed so closely on that
terrible struggle beneath them, rushed towards the rocks on the
other coast.&nbsp; The sound of oars was heard close to
them,&mdash;an eager pressing stroke, as of men who knew well
that they were rowing for the salvation of a life.&nbsp; On they
came, close under the rocks, obeying with every muscle of their
bodies the behests of those who called to them from the
shore.&nbsp; The boat came with such rapidity,&mdash;was so
recklessly urged, that it was driven somewhat beyond the inlet;
but in passing, a blow was struck which made Caleb Morton once
more the master of his own life.&nbsp; The two men had been
carried out in their struggle towards the open sea; and as the
boat curved in, so as to be as close as the rocks would allow,
the bodies of the men were brought within the sweep of the
oars.&nbsp; He in the bow&mdash;for there were four pulling in
the boat&mdash;had raised his oar as he neared the
rocks,&mdash;had raised it high above the water; and now, as they
passed close by the struggling men, he let it fall with all its
force on the upturned face of the wretched convict.&nbsp; It was
a terrible, frightful thing to do,&mdash;thus striking one who
was so stricken; but who shall say that the blow was not good and
just?&nbsp; Methinks, however, that the eyes and face of that
dying man will haunt for ever the dreams of him who carried that
oar!</p>
<p>Trow never rose again to the surface.&nbsp; Three days
afterwards his body was found at the ferry, and then they carried
him to the convict island and buried him.&nbsp; Morton was picked
up and taken into the boat.&nbsp; His life was saved; but it may
be a question how the battle might have gone had not that
friendly oar been raised in his behalf.&nbsp; As it was, he lay
at the cottage for days before he was able to be moved, so as to
receive the congratulations of those who had watched that
terrible conflict from the shore.&nbsp; Nor did he feel that
there had been anything in that day&rsquo;s work of which he
could be proud;&mdash;much rather of which it behoved him to be
thoroughly ashamed.&nbsp; Some six months after that he obtained
the hand of Anastasia Bergen, but they did not remain long in
Bermuda.&nbsp; &ldquo;He went away, back to his own
country,&rdquo; my informant told me; &ldquo;because he could not
endure to meet the ghost of Aaron Trow, at that point of the road
which passes near the cottage.&rdquo;&nbsp; That the ghost of
Aaron Trow may be seen there and round the little rocky inlet of
the sea, is part of the creed of every young woman in
Bermuda.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org
